"distribute-error":
"1", "proportional-value-w" The error is distributed as W(ij)/Sum(W(ij))
   W =     1  2       Wnew =   1/(1+2)        2/(1+2)     Enew = Wnew x E
           3  4                3/(3+4)        4/(3+4)


"bias": the function is not active. Need to determine, where should be use bias- 1) in level or global, one for the all level
